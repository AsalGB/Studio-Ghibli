            <h1>Studio Ghibli: Everything to know about the Japanese animation studio</h1>
            <p>Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki met in the 1960s when working for the Japanese animation studio Tôei Dôga. The two men worked together for more than a decade notably on the animation Heidi. But it wasn't until the early 1980s, when the growth of animation on television threatened the quality of productions, that these two enthusiasts decided to join forces to offer the public a quality animated feature film that would not overlook either the narration or the direction. In 1985, a first collaboration ensues, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, the animated adaptation of the manga published by Miyazaki in the magazine Animage. On the strength of this first success, and convinced that there is a place for quality animated feature films on the Japanese market, they set up a small production studio in the suburbs of Tokyo, with the help of the Tokuma Shoten publishing company. In 1986 The Castle in the Sky was released on the screens, the first film officially created by Studio Ghibli, now at the head of more than 40 film and video game productions.</p>

                <h1>If you want an Oscar winner…</h1>
                <p>Begin with Spirited Away (2001), which won the best animated feature trophy at the 2003 Academy Awards, and pretty much encapsulates the whole Ghibli ethos. Thanks to its high profile, this is often the movie that has introduced people to Ghibli. It’s a stunningly-realised tale of a 10-year-old girl, Chihiro, who is travelling with her parents to her new home. When her father takes a shortcut, Chihiro ends up lost and alone in the spirit world, and has to navigate a dreamlike landscape, populated by increasingly grotesque characters, in order to save her parents.</p>

            <h1>If you want a fairytale fantasy…</h1>
            <p>That description doesn’t really even touch the sides of Howl’s Moving Castle (2004). Loosely based on the 1986 Diana Wynne Jones novel, it features a strong anti-war message (apparently fuelled by Miyazaki’s opposition to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq) as two feuding kingdoms in a European-flavoured fantasy world go head-to-head, with the maverick magician Howl caught in the middle as his precarious castle on legs criss-crosses the war-torn territories. Young milliner Sophie is cursed by the Witch of the Waste and transformed into an old woman who gets caught up in Howl’s fight to not be drafted into the devastating war. Utterly captivating and memorable.</p>

                <h1>If you want a slice of reality…</h1>
                <p>Ghibli’s only proper biopic is The Wind Rises, released in 2013 and telling a fictionalised life story of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the infamous Mitsubishi Zero that formed the basis of Japan’s aerial might in World War Two. This being a Ghibli film, though, it’s not some tub-thumping celebration of a gung-ho life. Horikoshi dreams of flying planes but his poor eyesight doesn’t allow it, so he throws himself into engineering, and is devastated when his designs are used for war. This was Miyazaki’s last film before his short-lived retirement, which he came out of in 2017 to direct the as-yet unreleased How Do You Live?.  </p>

            <h1>If you want something different…</h1>
            <p>Well, all the Ghibli films are different, but two stand out as being animated in a completely different style to the studio’s usual look. The Tale of Princess Kaguya is one of the more recent movies, released in 2013 and based on the folk story The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. The final film directed by Takahata before his death in 2018, it’s about a poor couple who find a tiny girl growing inside a bamboo shoot, and it is almost like an old painting come to life. Similarly, My Neighbours The Yamadas (1999) is a charming little tale that starts as a family comedy before heading into surreal territory, yet is always warm and happy, more like an animated comic strip.</p>
