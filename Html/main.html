            <blockquote> <p>Right now, you are sitting in one of two camps – either you have no idea what Studio Ghibli is, or you are borderline obsessed with the output of the widely acclaimed Japanese animation house.
                OK, this is slightly hyperbolic, we’ll give you that. But only slightly. Even if you have never heard the name Studio Ghibli, you would need to have been living under a pretty sizable rock if titles like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Howl’s Moving Castle fail to ring any bells. Of the 25 highest-grossing films of all time in Japan, five are Studio Ghibli productions, with three in the top ten. The studio also has an Oscar under its belt for Best Animated Feature, and a prestigious Golden Bear award.</p> </blockquote>
